[Era]
CpuTargetLevel         = 50; reduces CPU load to 0..100%. Real effect will be even greater than specified value
UseOnlyOneCpuCore      = 0; if true, only one CPU core will be used, decreasing probability of crashes
FixGetHostByName       = 1; if true, current PC IP address detection is improved to exclude local addresses (192.168.x.x, etc)
LoadCD                 = 0; if true, an attempt to load resources from CD disk will be made, increasing game initialization by about 3-5 seconds
IgnoreInvalidReceivers = 0; not implemented

Debug                               = 1;      allow debugging at all or not, see Debug\Era directory
Debug.Everything                    = 0;      if true, enable all debugging options at once
Debug.AbortOnError                  = 0;      abort on serious, but not critical errors or not
Debug.LogDestination                = File;   logging driver: File or Console
Debug.LogVirtualFileSystem          = 0;      if true, Virtual File System work will be logged
Debug.DumpVirtualFileSystem         = 0;      if true, all Virtual File System mappings (per file) will be written to log during initialization
Debug.DumpSavegameSections          = 0;      if true, each game saving will create dump of each Era section in a separate file
Debug.TrackErm                      = 1;      if true, ERM commands and triggers will be tracked for report/debugging purposes
Debug.TrackErm.MaxRecords           = 10000;  maximal number of commands and events to track (1 record ~= 100 bytes RAM)
Debug.TrackErm.DumpCommands         = 1;      if true, all commands texts will be saved during execution, allowing to track ERM commands, executed by plugins
Debug.TrackErm.IgnoreEmptyTriggers  = 1;      if true, trigger start - trigger end pairs without executed commands will be ignored
Debug.TrackErm.IgnoreRealTimeTimers = 1;      if true, real time timers (!?TL) will be ignored
