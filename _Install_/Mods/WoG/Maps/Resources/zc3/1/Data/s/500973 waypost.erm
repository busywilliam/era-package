!!IF&-65:M^When you enter the Waypost, you notice that it is empty, except for a couple of dogs. It doesn't look damaged, nor abandoned in a hurry. Just, empty, like all inhabitants have just disappeared. Looking into the houses,  you can't find any clues to what might have happened. The only odd thing you find is that there are pools of water everywhere. Both Ellam and Aned express wishes to leave as soon as possible, and you couldn't agree more.^;
!!IF&65:M^The waypost still stands empty- no guards are willing to serve here..^;
