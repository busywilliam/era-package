!!IF&500:M^After the long and bloody battle that didn't end until the odd beast had enough arrows sticking out of its hide to make it look like an enormous, ugly hedgehog, a few gaping wounds you could, if you were willing to, which you certainly aren't considering the appearance of the beast, stick your head through, and several areas where the warty, hideous green skin has been burned to a charcoal black by your magic, you and Aned quickly gather the survivors to heal those in greatest need. After that, the task of removing the Sandals of the Most Holy Saint Amdron from the feet of the beast started, and it proved to be a difficult one as they somehow seemed to have been glued tight. You had little success until Aned started to burn through one of the short, massive legs while you and Vellan hacked through the other with your sword. After that, you held a quick council and decided to get out of the Z'akur as soon as possible. The trek back to Emokon was almost as long and bloody as the hunt was, and after the first night, the short stumps that still were stuck in the sandals started to smell. Badly. You had to halt for a day to slowly carve out all the remains, and when you were finished, the sandals were not only covered in mud, but in dark blood as well, making them look more like something found at a dump than a relic. When you finally returned to Emokon, tired and battered, you were taken to the Mayor, who congratulated you on a job well done and offered a place within the city guard as some sort of monster hunter. You declined, preferring the life of free adventuring, and set out on a new one, but that is a story for later.^;
