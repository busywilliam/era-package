!?OB58/61/1
!!IF:M^This portal at first looks like an exact copy of the one back in the forest, but you somehow get the feeling that this is the original and the one you stepped through is the clone. The feeling gets stronger when you discover a set of controls inlaid in it. Where the portal on the surface required nothing less than stepping through it for you to come here, you are afraid that stepping through this one might be the last mistake of your life.^;
