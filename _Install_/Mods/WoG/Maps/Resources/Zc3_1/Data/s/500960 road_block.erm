!!IF&-480:M^The Way of the Wolf actually passes through the Z'akur, since otherwise it would have to cross the Haram Deel twice- not an easy task, when spring floods make it rise twice as high. Therefore, The way of the Wolf shouldn't be traveled unless one has a good protection at hand, with all sorts of different freaky things crawling out of Z'akur.^;
